## Introduction  
BusSing is designed to respect your privacy. This policy is intended to be clear and concise for App Store review and for our commuters.  

---

## 1. Information We Collect  
- **Personal Information:** We do *not* require you to create an account and we do *not* collect personally identifiable information such as your name, email, or phone number.  
- **Location Data (optional):** With your permission, the App may access your device‚Äôs location to show nearby bus stops and provide location-based features (e.g., stop proximity, bus arrival relevance). Location data remains on your device and is *not* stored or shared by us.  
- **Usage & Diagnostics:** We may receive anonymized crash reports and performance metrics via Apple-provided analytics if you‚Äôve opted in at the system level. This information helps us maintain and improve the App and does not identify you.  
- **Local Preferences:** Favourites (e.g., saved bus stops), settings, and recent selections are stored *locally on your device*.  

---

## 2. How We Use Information  
We use the information collected solely to:  
- Provide real-time bus arrival information, routes, and nearby stops.  
- Enable location-based convenience (when granted) for quicker access to relevant stops.  
- Monitor stability and performance to improve the App experience.  

We do **not** sell, rent, or share your data with third parties for marketing purposes.  

---

## 3. Data Sharing & Third Parties  
- **Public Transport Data:** BusSing retrieves transport and traffic information from public or government-backed sources (e.g., *LTA DataMall*, public traffic camera feeds). These providers may have their own privacy practices and terms.  
- **Analytics:** If you opt in to share analytics with developers in iOS settings, Apple may provide us with anonymized diagnostics and usage information. You can manage this in your device settings.  

---

## 4. Data Storage & Security  
- BusSing does not maintain personal user accounts or store personal identifiers on our servers.  
- Settings and favourites are stored locally on your device.  
- We follow industry-standard practices designed to help protect your information from unauthorized access.  

---

## 5. Your Choices  
- **Location Permissions:** You can enable or disable location access at any time in your device settings.  
- **Favourites & Local Data:** You can remove local data (e.g., saved stops) at any time, and uninstalling the App will delete locally stored data associated with BusSing.  
- **Analytics Opt-Out:** You can manage sharing of diagnostics and usage data with Apple in your device settings.

## 6. Children‚Äôs Privacy  
BusSing does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided information to us, please contact us so we can address the issue.  

---

## 7. Changes to This Policy  
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the ‚ÄúLast updated‚Äù date at the top of this page. Your continued use of the App after changes take effect indicates your acceptance of the updated policy.
